# Kniwwelino-Snake
A snake game for the [LIST Kniwwelino](http://www.kniwwelino.lu/en/) board.

I made this for anyone who is interested in making something similar on the Kniwwlino (I had a **ton** of trouble with this). One can look at my code and be like "oh, so this is how you do it" :)

Instead of choosing "Kniwwelino" from the boards manager (I could not get it working), I chose the "Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266" with CPU frequency set to `80MHz`, flash size to `4M (3M SPIFFS)` and upload speed to `916200`. The programmer I used was `AVRISP mkll`.

So for those people who get the `Error downloading http://doku.kniwwelino.lu/_media/en/download/package_esp8266_kniwwelino_index.json` (yeah, I know it is **really** annoying) you can try this. It worked for me.

If it does work, you're welcome.
